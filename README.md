# Civic Issue Reporting System

A full-stack web application for reporting and managing civic issues like potholes, broken streetlights, garbage overflow, and water leakage with GPS location tracking and image evidence.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to backend directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Make sure `.env` file is configured with:
```
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
NODE_ENV=development
```

4. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run server
```

Backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup

1. Open a new terminal and navigate to frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`

## 🧪 Testing the Application

### Using Postman/Thunder Client

See `backend/API_TESTING.md` for detailed API documentation and testing examples.

### Test Accounts

1. Create a regular user:
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "phone": "1234567890"
}
```

2. Create an admin (register first, then update role in MongoDB)

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user

### Issues
- `POST /api/issues` - Create issue (with image upload)
- `GET /api/issues` - Get all issues (with filters)
- `GET /api/issues/:id` - Get single issue
- `GET /api/issues/nearby/:lng/:lat/:distance` - Find nearby issues
- `PUT /api/issues/:id/status` - Update status (Admin only)
- `DELETE /api/issues/:id` - Delete issue
- `GET /api/issues/admin/stats` - Get statistics (Admin only)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend not starting
- Check if MongoDB connection string is correct in `.env`
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check if port 5000 is available

### Frontend not connecting to backend
- Verify backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`
- Check CORS configuration in backend
- Ensure API URL is correct in `frontend/src/services/api.js`

### Images not uploading
- Check if `uploads/` folder exists in backend
- Verify file size is less than 5MB
- Ensure image format is jpeg, jpg, png, or gif

### Map not loading
- Check internet connection (maps require external resources)
- Verify Leaflet CSS is loaded in `index.html`

## 🚀 Deployment

### Backend Deployment (e.g., Heroku, Railway)
1. Set environment variables
2. Update MONGO_URI to production database
3. Deploy using platform-specific commands

### Frontend Deployment (e.g., Vercel, Netlify)
1. Update API URL in `src/services/api.js` to production backend URL
2. Build: `npm run build`
3. Deploy the `dist` folder
